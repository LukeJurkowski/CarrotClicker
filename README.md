A programme that executes in-game mechanics for you.
Basically it clicks on a place on your screen and then presses keyboard button and repeats the whole thing X times.
You can stop the programme at any moment by clicking 'EMERGENCY EXIT'.

I've created it for a small mini-game I used to enjoy a lot.
That was the only part of the game that was boring, so the programme was made only for that one specific part of the game.

If you are wondering, I've tried to follow the typical MVC design pattern where:
- Model is the Model
- UIMain is the View
- Controller is the Controller
along with those, there are:
- 'About' - containing my contact info and how to use the programme
- 'App' - the class that launches the programme
